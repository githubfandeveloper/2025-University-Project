## Project Background

You have been given the task of designing a secured network for a small and medium enterprise (SME). Your responsibilities encompass robust and scalable network architecture that integrates cloud solutions with traditional on-premises networks specifically for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

The design should prioritise seamless connectivity and performance optimisation while implementing a comprehensive security framework, including:
- Firewalls  
- Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)  
- Data encryption  

These features aim to safeguard the network against cyber threats. The solution must be cost-effective, leveraging affordable cloud resources that balance reliability with the budget constraints typical of SMEs.

By addressing real-world challenges in network design, cloud integration, and cybersecurity, you are required to produce a **practical prototype**, demonstrating a network infrastructure that meets the unique needs of SMEs in today’s digital landscape.

Your project mentor assumes the role of your client, necessitating open discussions to ensure all requirements are properly understood and incorporated into your design.

For the **prototype implementation**, it is crucial to construct an actual network using the network equipment available in the **CQUniversity ICT Labs**, such as:
- Cisco switches  
- Cisco routers  
- Ubiquiti WiFi access points  

Alternatively, you may choose to acquire your own equipment. Additionally, integrating certain cloud services into your prototype implementation will be essential.

> **Note:** Virtualisation or simulation alone will not suffice — building a physical network prototype is necessary to demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of your design.

A brief project background is provided above; students are encouraged to finalise the requirements in consultation with the project mentor.

### Industry Focus
For this project, you are required to choose a **specific industry** for your target SME. Your design must be aligned with the specific industry requirements.
